### Welcome! 
We’re glad to see you are interested in contributing. We hope to build a community around developing this project and helping as many people as possible. 

The following are guidelines that we feel will nudge developers toward correct choices while making contributions. Feel free to point out anything that could be improved/changed in a pull request.


<br></br>
### How to Contribute?

To contribute, please issue a pull request using the following procedure:
1. Make sure that any install or build dependencies are removed before the layer end while doing a build.

2. Update the README.md with the appropriate changes to the interface, such as a change in the environment variables, an update in version number. Also, update navigation changes such as file location changes and dependency changes to the readme. 

3. Make sure to document any changes/additions you make to packages or libraries that need to be installed, since all of the commands to install new packages have to be run any time a new server instance is created.

4. Update the version number and relevant code in demonstration/example files and in README.md to the new version.

5. Ensure that all of the test cases are passed before merging the pull request.

6. We request that you allow complete access to all developers, but take the optional approval of all of the developers before merging the pull request to minimize any unexpected bugs. This also works well with the Linux best practices principle of zero internal boundaries.

<br></br>
### Some other things to consider when merging a pull request
* Be clear with the exact problem that you’re trying to solve/feature you’re trying to add. You can refer to our defined objectives for what we would do ourselves should we have had to carry this project into phase 2/3.

* Ensure that it is of good quality. The language should be clear and concise without any spelling or grammar mistakes.

* Make sure that any contribution of any sort follows the code of conduct. Our repository has a [code of conduct](https://github.com/ineelshah/SRIJAS/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and any pull request that does not respect these will be appropriately removed.
